# Employee Management System Frontend

This frontend interacts with my [Employee Management System Backend](https://github.com/1GodLess5/employee-management-system-backend). It provides a user-friendly interface for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee data. <br/><br/><br/>
